  <h1>Safety with Formlabs resin products</h1>
  <p class="meta"><strong>Applies to:</strong> Form 1+, Form 2, Form 3, Form 3B, Form 3BL, Form 3L, Form 4, Form 4L, Form Wash / Wash L, Form Cure / Cure L, Fast Cure</p>

  <p id="tldr" class="tldr"><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Use a ventilated, designated area with stable surfaces. Avoid lifting devices by covers and beware of hot surfaces after printing or post-cure. Handle resins and solvents like IPA/TPM with care, away from heat and sparks, and wear nitrile or neoprene gloves, safety glasses, and protective clothing. Printers use interlocks and enclosures for safety; do not bypass them. Always consult the Safety Data Sheet (SDS) for materials.</p>

  </nav>

  <h2 id="workplace-safety">Workplace safety</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Designate a specific SLA printing area on a stable, level surface, separate from dusty or sparking equipment.</li>
    <li>Ensure the area is ventilated; avoid operating in closed, unventilated rooms. Follow local code requirements for occupied spaces and ventilation (see references in Related resources).</li>
    <li>Keep chemicals and consumables organized; promptly clean spills and residues according to local regulations.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="setup-and-lifting">Setup and lifting</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Desktop devices (e.g., Form 4, Form Wash, Form Cure) can be set up by one person.</li>
    <li>Team lift large devices (Form 4L, Wash L, Cure L) using provided straps or slings.</li>
    <li><strong>Do not lift or move a device</strong> by its cover or moving parts, while it is powered, or while network/USB cables are connected.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="hot-surfaces">Hot surfaces</h2>
  <h3>Printers</h3>
  <p>During printing, resin is typically heated to about <strong>35&nbsp;°C (95&nbsp;°F)</strong>. Some printers (Form 2, Form 4) heat from under the resin tank; those areas can be hot immediately after a job. Other printers (Form 3/3L) use air heaters. Allow components to cool before handling.</p>
  <h3>Post-curing</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Form Cure / Form Cure L:</strong> Heaters and fans can leave surfaces and parts hot during or after cycles. Let parts and fixtures cool before removal.</li>
    <li><strong>Form Cure (1st Gen):</strong> The turntable may remain hot after a cure cycle; allow it to cool completely before touching or cleaning.</li>
    <li><strong>Fast Cure:</strong> LED banks generate heat; parts and trays may be hot. Use thermal-insulating gloves rated to at least <strong>160&nbsp;°C (320&nbsp;°F)</strong> when handling hot components.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="air-quality">Air quality and testing</h2>
  <p>Formlabs conducts internal room and employee exposure assessments and compares results to Section 8 exposure limits in the material SDS. Results at Formlabs facilities remain below OSHA exposure limits for chemicals used. Respirator use for routine printing tasks is considered voluntary at Formlabs.</p>
  <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Air quality results from one facility are not transferable. Conduct site-specific assessments for your own workplace and follow local requirements.</p>

  <h2 id="handling-resins-and-solvents">Handling resins and solvents</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Handle liquid resin and wash solvents with care; keep IPA/TPM containers closed when not in use.</li>
    <li>Work away from heat, sparks, and open flames. Solvent vapors may be flammable.</li>
    <li>Dispose of resin waste and used solvents per local regulations and SDS guidance.</li>
    <li>When washing parts, follow device-specific safety guidance for Form Wash / Wash L.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="ppe">Personal protective equipment (PPE)</h2>
  <table>
    <thead><tr><th>Area</th><th>Recommendation</th></tr></thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr><td>Hands</td><td>Wear <strong>nitrile or neoprene gloves</strong>. Wash skin with soap and water if exposed.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Eyes</td><td>Wear <strong>safety glasses</strong>, especially during post-processing and support removal.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Clothing</td><td>Wear long sleeves and pants; launder work clothing routinely.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Respiratory</td><td>Consider <strong>N95 or better</strong> if SDS exposure limits may be exceeded or ventilation is insufficient. Wet sanding helps reduce dust.</td></tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <p class="meta">PPE recommendations align with Sections 7 and 8 of Formlabs SLA resin SDS.</p>

  <h2 id="device-safety-features">Device safety features</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Printers:</strong> Interlocks prevent laser or LEDs/heaters from operating with covers or doors open. Translucent covers allow monitoring of the print enclosure.</li>
    <li><strong>Wash:</strong> Form Wash / Wash L use double lids to keep the solvent bath covered during and between cycles.</li>
    <li><strong>Cure:</strong> Form Cure / Cure L / Fast Cure include interlocks that prevent motors, LEDs, and heaters from powering on with covers or doors open.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="light-source-safety">Light source safety</h2>
  <p>Form 1+, Form 2, and Form 3-series printers are <strong>Class&nbsp;1 Laser Devices</strong> in normal use due to enclosures and interlocks, despite using Class&nbsp;3B lasers internally. <strong>Form 4 / 4L</strong> use <strong>405&nbsp;nm LEDs</strong> instead of lasers. Do not defeat safety systems.</p>

  <h2 id="maintenance">Maintenance and housekeeping</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Clean resin spills and solvent residues promptly.</li>
    <li>Perform routine maintenance on printers and Form Wash devices per the manuals to help ensure safe operation.</li>
  </ul>
